These are the real-world applications included in this project

- Modeling disease spread in a virtual world. The diseases we explored were Covid 19 and Ebola
- Brownian Motion combined with Monte Carlo to simulate future price paths and analysis on the outcomes
- Game engines to predict the next best move in a reasonable amount of time. Used tic tac toe as an example
