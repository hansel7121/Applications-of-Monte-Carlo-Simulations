    "# Disease Spread Modeling With Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "The real world is full of uncertainty and randomness. This is where Monte Carlo Simulations come in. Monte Carlo helps us model uncertainty and randomness in our models. This is one example of how Monte Carlo Simulations can be used to model disease spread. Lets focus on the newest and most discussed virus, Covid-19.\n",

    "## Parameters\n",
    "There are few parameters we need to set before we start simulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- infection_prob: The probability of infection per contact\n",
    "- mortality_prob: The probability of mortality per infection\n",
    "- contacts_per_day: The number of contacts between people per day\n",
    "- days: The number of days to simulate\n",
    "- resolution_duration: The duration of the resolution. Resolution here implies the virus leaves the body, in either a recovery or death.\n",

    "We will be utilizing the random module to generate random numbers between 0 to 1 (serving as probabilities) to model the randomness of everyday life.\n",
